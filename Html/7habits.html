<h1>7 The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Build Managers</h1>

<p>How do you seek to be successful?  Stephen Covey started researching this very question and didn't like the answers.  All the advice seemed to be about changing your external appearance and behaviour and not actually changing yourself.  So he sat down and wrote the decade's self-improvement book.  "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People" is a classic of it's kind; it prescribes some difficult advice for becoming a better (and more effective) person.  I have to confess that I was sceptical about reading the book "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People". I've seen my fair share of self-improvement literature and don't often value it.  My lovely project manager (hello Ines!) was persuasive  however, and I'm glad I did.  I have no doubt that if you apply the advice, you will be more successful.</p>

<p>The book inspired me to write a series on of posts to see if the same rules apply to build managers.  I hope you like it. The book is for sale on Amazon [UK Link], [US Link]</p>


<h2>1. Be proactive</h2>

<p>Stephen R. Covey suggested that this was the first point to start with in the workplace, and I don't think the advice hurts at all in the Build Manager workplace.  Do be proactive.  Don't wait for the disk on that server to fill up; put a script on the clean up the dross, and configure your Continuous Integration server to tidy up its artifacts.  Don't forget the logrotate config to compress any old logs.</p>
<p> That goofy guy who always asks you to do things at the last minute?  Don't get angry at him.  Get organised.  If you can tell that he's going to need help getting his code built or into production, don't wait for him to ask: yes he should be planning ahead, but will he?  You may as well do everything you can to be prepared in the probable event that he comes and asks to you help him.  Better now than at 6pm on a Friday.</p>
