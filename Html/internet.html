<h1>How the web works.</h1>
<h2>IP Addresses</h2>
<p>To be <i>on the Internet</i>, your computer has to have an IP address.  It might have many IP addresses, but it needs at least one.  The system of IP addresses that most of us use right now (IPV4) supports about 4 billion addresses.  There's more people on Earth than that.  Neal Stevenson once pointed out that about half of the people on the planet are field-stripping their AK-47&apos;s and making mud bricks.  Even once you discount those people, that&apos;s still not enough IP addresses.</p>

<p>How do we deal with this scarcity of IP addresses?  We share.  When you connect to your ISP at home, your computer probably gets a new IP address each time.  The ISP is allocated a block of addresses(just like a city block has many addresses in it).  You need an address.  The ISP loans you one (technically the term is "lease", but don't worry: you won't pay for it, and there's no late fees).  You finish with it.  The ISP hands it back.</p>
<h2>Now you're stalking</h2>
This is the first challenge in identifying people online; they don't always connect from the same IP address.  Organisations can be allocated blocks of IP addresses, and someone will connect from one of that block.  You <b>can</b> identify who owns the block, however.  The "whois" tool will tell you who owns the IP address and how to contact them.  If you want to find out who was using a particular ISP at a particular time, there's two problems:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Did the organisation bother keeping records, and </li>
  <li>Will they tell you without a court order</li>
</ul>

The next challenge is finding out who actually used the computer that was given the IP address.  And even then you're assuming that one computer used the address.  Remember how every computer needs an IP address to be on the Internet?  There's no reason why many computers can't share one IP address.</p>
